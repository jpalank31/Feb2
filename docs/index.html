    <h2>âœ¨Sunday, February 2, 2025âœ¨</h2>
    <h1>Chris.<br />Darling.<br />Friend.<br />Greatest of people.</h1>
    <p class="p1">
      I wanted to give you something that would help make your days just a
      little brighter for the next few weeks.
      <br />
    </p>

    <h3>So welcome to <strong>"A Glimmer A Day."</strong></h3>
    <p class="p2">
      There is 17 days' worth of "glimmerful" content here (assuming I coded
      this right and it works! ðŸ˜‚).
      <br />
      You will only be able to click on a button once that day arrives (so no
      cheating and looking at everything all at once).
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
      At this point, I'm either about to get on a plane or am already on one. I
      likely won't be able to communicate with you much in the next 24 hours.
      This isn't a death note because I refuse to write those, but I do want to
      take this moment to tell you how much you mean to me, how much I
      appreciate you, and how incredibly grateful I am to have you in my life.
      <br />
      <br />
      I can't believe how fast 6.5 years has flown by. How I feel like I know
      you so well and yet still have so much left to learn about you. I would
      not be who I am today without your influence in my life. I am so proud of
      how far I've come, of who I am, and who I am becoming. I put in a lot of
      work to get to this point, but much of it was also shaped by you. Thank
      you for being by my side every step of the journey. Your infinite
      patience, consistency, encouragement, belief in me, and steadfastness made
      and make more of a difference in my life than you will ever know. You are
      a true friend in every sense of the word. The best, really.
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
      So, thanks for being my best best friend. It's such an honor to be counted
      as one of yours. ðŸ¤ž
    </p>
    <p class="p2">
      I hope you have a wonderful Sunday! Cheers to the next adventure of a
      lifetime. ðŸ’¥
    </p>
